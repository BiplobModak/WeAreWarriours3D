# WeAreWarriours3D

Objective: Recreate the main mechanic in 3d. Use 3d character and 3d environment. Write clean manageable code.

 

The main mechanic contains

Meat generation
Spawning of enemy waves
Spawning of player warriors
Ability to keep playing the game

What to keep in mind when making the prototype

* Keep it simple but polish the mechanic as much as you like. 
* Add character animations, combat animations, sfx, vfx etc
* Keep the system scalable. Your implementation should be extendable enough that anyone can add new variations of enemies and warriors later with different ability and stats
* The warriors/enemies animator should be extendable for future variations
* Use git from the beginning of the project and commit changes frequently. Once you are done with a small feature, commit and push before moving on to next feature

Additional things you can do (Optional)

Implement a variation of the enemy to show the extensibility of your system
If you use ChatGPT or any other AI tool, you can include the chat history in your submission. Ability to use ChatGPT is a great skill to have. So show it off.
Implement any other feature you like from the original game
Keep the UI simple and should work on mobile and tablets
